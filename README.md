# Guess a number Game
## Introduction
This is a game, where you need to guess if the next random number will be higher or lower than the current number. If you guess 5 correct you will win, and if you guess 5 wrong you loose. 
There is 3 levels - easy, medium and hard. Every level has an individual number range. Easy has a number range from 1 - 50, medium from 1 - 25, and hard from 1 - 10. 
The idea is, that the smaller the number range, the harder it is to guess correct.
This game was developed as a project delivery in a course, where we should use javascript, html and CSS.
